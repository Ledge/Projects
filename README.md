This is a bunch of my projects which I've decided to share with people who find them interesting. Most of the are incomplete and full of buggs, but usabe.

## Applications ##
* Gymnastics - An unfinished application I made for a friend, but interest was lost.
* Animation - One of my first applications, just a concept.
* Infinite mouse - A helper application when using multiple screens to ease the movement of the mouse
* Zombies - The first project I made when I started learning Java. It's unoptimized, but works.
